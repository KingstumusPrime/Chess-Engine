# Chess Engine

This is a simple chess engine written in JavaScript. I was just starting to get into chess, so I figured this project was a great way to mix my passions. Along with the engine, I also created a basic AI using alpha-beta pruning. Though there must be a bug somewhere in this, as I cannot get above a depth of two moves without the browser crashing.

## Features

* Player vs Player, AI vs AI, and AI vs Player modes
* En Passant
* Loading of FEN notation
* Castling
* Pawn Promotions (only UI for queen)
